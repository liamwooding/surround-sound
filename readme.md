#Surround sound through your phone(s)

The aim of this is to create a system which allows an arbitrary number of devices to be used to play positional audio

- Connect to an audio array using a web-capable device with a speaker (phone, tablet or laptop)
- The server generates a sound at a set of coordinates
- The sound plays on all devices that are near those coordinates, volume adjusted for distance

#Components

- 


Future nice:

- See display of connected devices and their positions
- Adjust own device's position in array
